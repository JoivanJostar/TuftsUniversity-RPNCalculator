# Purpose

This program is the Project2 RPNCalc Phase 1.

it contains 1 class DatumStack and 1 paser.cpp which implements the parserRString function.


# Acknowledgements

the DatumStack is implemented by C++ STL < list >.

# FILES

DatumStack.h  : the head file that defines the * DatumStack * 's  basic structure and interfaces.

DatumStack.cpp  : implementations of  * DatumStack *

parser.cpp  : implementations of  * string parseRString(istream& input) * 

unit_tests.h : the unit test functions of  * DatumStack * and * parseRString *  it should be included in unit_test_driver.cpp.

unit_test_driver.cpp: a simple driver that calls all the unit_test functions in "unit_tests.h".

Makefile  :Used to make compilation and unit testing, creates an  execution of unit test called "unit_test".



# COMPILE &RUN

type "make" to use the makefile to build the project  and then run unit_test
# Test

The test code is in the unit_tests.h 

All of the interfaces has been tested, including some edge tests:
1.	try top() from an empty stack
2.	pop from an empty stack
